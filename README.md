Build a Bitmap reader and transformer. It will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project should include tests, as well as a Gruntfile and package.json file. Make sure to run all your code through jshint and jscs. The process will look something like this:

1. Open file using fs and read it into a buffer

2. Convert buffer into a Javascript Object

3. Run a transform on that Javascript Object.

4. Turn the transformed object back into a buffer.

5. Write that buffer to a new file.
